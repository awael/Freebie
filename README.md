1- Project Overview

Freebie aims to address multiple issues including the prevalence of poverty, the increased clutter and unneeded items in many households, and the large gap between some communities. Freebie tries to bridge this gap by acting as a platform for people to post their items to give away, along with contact information and pickup location, for NGOs to come pick it up free of charge.
