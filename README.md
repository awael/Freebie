1- Project Overview

Freebie aims to address multiple issues including the prevelence of poverty, the increased clutter and unneeded items in many households, and the large gap between some comunities. Freebie tries to bridge this gap by acting as a platform for people to post their items to give away, along with contact information and pickup location, for any interested party to come pick it up free of charge. Freebie will limit users by tying accounts by their authenticated cell phone numbers in order to avoid exploitation of the system
